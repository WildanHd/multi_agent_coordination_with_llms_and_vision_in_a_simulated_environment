# multi_agent_coordination_with_llms_and_vision_in_a_simulated_environment
 This repository contains the code for multi agent coordination project. The project integrate LLMs and Vision machine learning algorithm to execute different task. This time I consider simple simulated environment for example on object location detection and moving object task.
